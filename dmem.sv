/* dmem is a more traditional, albeit very uninteresting, random access 64 word x 32 bit per word memory.
** This module is also written in RTL, and likely strongly resembles your own register file except for a 
** few minor differences. The first is that there is only a single read port, compared to the register 
** fileâ€™s two read ports. The other difference is that the dmem is also byte aligned, and therefore 
** discards the bottom two bits of the address when doing a read or write.

// rd_data - the data currently stored at memory[addr]
